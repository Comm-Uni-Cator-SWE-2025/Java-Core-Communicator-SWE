# Contributing to the repo

1. Create a branch named `your_name/feature/feature_name` or `your_name/fix/fix-name`, etc. Work on that branch and push your changes on that branch only.
2. Once complete, create a _pull request_ to merge into `module/chat` branch.
3. Merging a PR request requires at-least one `review approval`. Add `@AkshayJadhav96` and `your other teammate` for review.

Note: When creating a new branch, create it from `module/chat` only.
```bash
git checkout module/chat
git branch <branch_name_as_specified_above>
```
```bash
git checkout <your_branch>
```
